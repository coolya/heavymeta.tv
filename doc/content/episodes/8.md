This part details on editor testing and builds tests for common use cases in the editor. The second half introduces some
of the other aspects of MPS to the language. You will explore the use cases of intentions, refactoring and actions. As a
bonus you will use the MPS APIs to interact with your language meta model to dynamically retrieve the available concepts
of your language.
