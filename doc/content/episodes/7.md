This part introduces nesting of scopes to allow shadowing names of variables and talks briefly about testing languages.
For scoping some of the integrated scopes of MPS are explained the _Hiding By Name_ Scope in particular. In language 
testing the _node test_ aspect is covered extensively but editor tests are introduces briefly as well. With _node tests_
the type system which was introduced over the previous two parts is tested for correct type calculation and error 
reporting.
