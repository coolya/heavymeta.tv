After building the first editors for the expression language with vanilla MPS this video will introduce you to 
_grammar cells_ which is part of the MPS Extensions. You will use grammar cells to rebuild the existing editor to be 
able to compare the two approaches. Though the further tutorials we will use _grammar cells_ when possible because of
it advantages over using MPS out of the box. This part will also explain you the limitations of _grammar cells_ and 
give you example when to not use them. In the second half this part introduces the basics of type system to assert the
correctness of the program.

**Note:** when you follow the instructions in the video and add the grammar cell concepts to you editor you will get an
error message `Error Missing Dependency on jetbrains.mps.lang.core` or similar. When you place the cursor on the error 
and open the intentions menu (`alt + enter`) there is an intention to fix the error. The intention will add a new
root node to your editor aspect. That root adds a dependency that is required because of recent API changes in the editor runtime.
