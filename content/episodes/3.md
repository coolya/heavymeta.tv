You will continue further with your language definition that we started you started in the last episode. This time the focus is on making the language easier to use and behave like a text editor to meet the users expectations. The implementation is done with "vanilla" MPS and not third party libraries are used. To achieve this goal we will use the substitute menu and actions from MPS.
