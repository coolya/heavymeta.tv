Heavy Meta TV hosts an in depth tutorial for JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) of about 20 hours. The tutorials 
were filmed as part of a series of live streams in 2018/2019. Since then MPS hasn't changed fundamentally so most of the
content is still up to date. The series starts with a general introduction into modeling / language engineering and a 
general introduction into the various aspects of MPS. At the end of the tutorial you will have build a complete 
expression language from start to finish including a simple code generator to Java. The tutorial encourages coding along
but feel free to jump in at any point. Each episode links to github where the project is in the same state as at the 
beginning of the episode which should make it easy to get started. Since each episode builds on the previous one it can 
hard to skip episodes if you aren't familiar with basics. The source code for each episode is update along with new MPS 
releases which will allow you to use the current version of MPS.

In addition to the video and the source code each episode links to additional documentation and information on the topic
it covers.

Feel free to give feedback or contribute to the descriptions or links in each video they all feature a little feedback 
and edit button that allows you to contribute via Github. Of course you can also find the 
[source code](https://github.com/coolya/heavymeta.tv) of the page there.
