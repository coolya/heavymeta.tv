Heavy Meta TV hosts an in depth tutorial for JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS) of about 20 hours. The tutorial 
were filmed as part of a series of live streams in 2018/2019. Since then MPS hasn't changed fundamentally and  most of the
content is still up to date. Throughout the tutorial a simple expression language is used to teach the basics of developing
languages inside of MPS. The videos heavily emphasis language design and discusses tradeoff and real word experience of
the various design decision take through the course of implementation. 

The series starts with a general introduction into modeling / language engineering and a 
general introduction into the various aspects of MPS. At the end of the tutorial you will have build a complete 
expression language from start to finish including a simple code generator to Java. The tutorial encourages coding along
but feel free to jump in at any point. Each episode links to github where the project is in the same state as at the 
beginning of the episode which should make it easy to get started. Since each episode builds on the previous one it can 
hard to skip episodes if you aren't familiar with basics. The source code for each episode is update along with new MPS 
releases which will allow you to use the current version of MPS.

In addition to the video and the [source code](https://github.com/coolya/basic-lang) each episode links to additional 
documentation and information on the topic it covers.

Feel free to give feedback or contribute to the descriptions or links in each video they all feature a little feedback 
and edit button that allows you to contribute via Github. Of course you can also find the 
[source code](https://github.com/coolya/heavymeta.tv) of the page there.
